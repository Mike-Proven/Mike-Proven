### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m trying to decide on a focus in programming, but it's difficult when so much interests me. I am leaning towards Cobol as of late just to help preserve the infrastructure that makes our world work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of the People, April 2024.
- :thinking: I'm intrigued by the ability to do anything with C++, Rust, or Zig. I'm also interested in reverse engineering and learning Assembly.
