### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I've completed an IBM Specialization Certificate in COBOL and will begin to make COBOL projects here to build a working portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of the People, April 2024.
- :thinking: I'm intrigued by the ability to do anything with C++, Rust, or Zig. I'm also interested in reverse engineering and learning Assembly.
- 
- NOTE to SELF: ~~I have to focus on getting a career with COBOL first before exploring other things related to my hobbies.~~
- Getting anything in the computer science industry will have to be postponed. Going back to ESL teaching, this time in Vietnam.
