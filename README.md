### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working towards & learning blockchain development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of the People <graduate 2023>
- :thinking: I'm not sure what to specialize in as a software developer, but I'm more intrigued by the ability to do anything with C++ or Rust.
- :eye_speech_bubble: Coming soon, repos with practice using C++ and Rust
