### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing an app for ESL teaching in the classroom, to better enhance the classroom experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of the People <graduate 2023>
- :thinking: I'm really not sure what to focus on or specialize in as a software developer, but day by day I'm more intrigued by the ability to do anything with C++ or Rust and I have some ideas for utilizing blockchain in a cloud-data capacity for enterprise security, and not so much as a currency or token.
- :eye_speech_bubble: Coming soon, repos with practice using C++ and Rust
