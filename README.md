### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m trying to decide a focus in programming, but it's difficult when so much interests me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of the People <graduate 2024>
- :thinking: I'm more intrigued by the ability to do anything with C++, Rust, or Zig. 
- :eye_speech_bubble: Coming soon, I'm starting to work with Go now.
